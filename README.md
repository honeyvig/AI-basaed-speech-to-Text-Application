# AI-basaed-speech-to-Text-Application


We are looking for an experienced developer to create a complete speech-to-text front-end and back-end application that utilizes AI technology to process Indian voices. The application should incorporate a medical dictionary and be compatible across all mobile, desktop, and web platforms. The ideal candidate should have a solid understanding of voice recognition technologies and machine learning, especially in the context of medical terminologies. If you are passionate about innovative solutions in healthcare and have the skills to bring this project to life, we would love to hear from you!
we attached a PDF of the project details, the developer needs to complete all features and workflow mentioned in the PDF
===================================
To create a speech-to-text application tailored for Indian voices with a medical dictionary, here is a high-level structure of the project. Below is a Python-based outline utilizing relevant libraries and frameworks:
Key Features of the Application

    Speech Recognition: Leverage AI-powered models trained for Indian accents and medical terminologies.
    Medical Dictionary Integration: Use pre-built or custom datasets for medical terms.
    Cross-Platform Support: Build the frontend using a framework like React (for web) and React Native (for mobile), while using Python/Flask or FastAPI for the backend.
    Cloud Storage and Processing: Store and process audio files and results on AWS or Azure.
    Customization for Indian Context: Train models using Indian voices to ensure higher accuracy.

Basic Implementation Overview
1. Backend: Speech-to-Text Processing

Using Google Speech-to-Text API or Wav2Vec2 (Hugging Face) with a medical dictionary.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import whisper  # OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model("base")  # or "large" for higher accuracy

# Example Medical Dictionary
medical_terms = ["hypertension", "diabetes", "arrhythmia", "neuroblastoma"]

def enhance_with_medical_terms(text):
    """Enhance transcribed text with medical terms."""
    for term in medical_terms:
        pattern = re.compile(term, re.IGNORECASE)
        text = pattern.sub(term, text)
    return text

@app.route('/transcribe', methods=['POST'])
def transcribe_audio():
    """
    Endpoint for speech-to-text transcription.
    Expects an audio file (e.g., .wav or .mp3).
    """
    audio_file = request.files['audio']
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

    # Post-process transcription
    processed_text = enhance_with_medical_terms(result['text'])
    return jsonify({"transcription": processed_text})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

2. Medical Dictionary Integration

You can either use open-source medical dictionaries like SNOMED CT or train a language model to recognize medical terms using fine-tuning techniques.

from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Tokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load pre-trained Wav2Vec2 Model
tokenizer = Wav2Vec2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53")
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53")

# Fine-tune on medical-specific dataset (assume you have audio and transcript data)
dataset = load_dataset("common_voice", "hi")  # Indian language dataset for Hindi

3. Frontend Application

Using React.js (web) and React Native (mobile):

React.js Example for Uploading Audio:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);
  const [result, setResult] = useState('');

  const uploadAudio = async () => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('audio', file);

    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/transcribe', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    setResult(data.transcription);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Speech-to-Text Application</h1>
      <input type="file" accept="audio/*" onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files[0])} />
      <button onClick={uploadAudio}>Upload</button>
      <p>Transcription: {result}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

4. Deployment

    Use Docker for containerizing the application.
    Deploy using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, or Google Cloud Run for scalability.

Dockerfile Example:

FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ffmpeg libsndfile1-dev && \
    pip install flask whisper transformers datasets

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Next Steps

    Enhance Transcription Quality
        Fine-tune models (e.g., Wav2Vec2) with datasets tailored to Indian voices.
        Incorporate real-world medical terms using transfer learning.
    Add Multi-Language Support
        Extend support for regional languages like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu.
    UI/UX for End Users
        Design an intuitive interface using React Native for seamless mobile and desktop experiences.
    Scale and Monitor
        Use CloudWatch (AWS) or Azure Monitor for application monitoring.
        Implement caching for frequently used queries.
